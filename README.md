# parkly-mobile
This mobile app is a simple app for admins of parking spot rental service. It was written in react-native as a semestral project for React course at MINI faculty at WUT.

## Disclaimar
This app was just one of three parts of semestral project. It requires fully functioniong backend (second part of semestral project) and without it is pretty unusable. Those are some examples of how it looked like:
